This is a nodejs project using youtube data api v3. 

In this project oauth2.0 is used for authentication.

The user would be able to gain access to the app using a google account. 
Once given permission the app will access the youtube subscription list of the user and display the subscribed channel as thumbnails.

This project as for now can be installed and run using localhost.

Before running the project, create and download key.json file by registering an application for using data api v3.This will help in creating oauth api credentials for the project(https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).

You can use nodemon to run the application using command line.
